    About Us
   </h2>
   <p class="mb-4">
    Welcome to Kedai Coldbrew XYZ, where every cup of coffee tells a story. Founded in 2020 in the vibrant heart of Yogyakarta, Indonesia, our journey began with a passion for coffee and a dream to create a unique coffee experience. Inspired by Indonesia's rich coffee culture and traditions, we are dedicated to delivering high-quality, authentic flavors that leave a lasting impression. Our founder, Ariiq Hafizh, is a true coffee enthusiast with a deep appreciation for the art of coffee making. Ariiq's journey into the world of coffee began many years ago when he worked as a barista in a small coffee shop. His passion for coffee grew as he learned about different brewing methods and experimented with various coffee beans. In 2020, Ariiq decided to turn his passion into a business and opened the first Kedai Coldbrew XYZ in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The initial response from the community was overwhelming, and it wasn't long before the shop became a popular destination for coffee lovers. Ariiq's dedication to quality and innovation set Kedai Coldbrew XYZ apart from other coffee shops, and the brand quickly gained a loyal following. Over the years, Kedai Coldbrew XYZ has grown from a single shop to multiple locations across Indonesia. Despite the expansion, our core values remain the same: to provide exceptional coffee and create a welcoming environment for our customers. At Kedai Coldbrew XYZ, we believe that coffee is more than just a beverage; it's a way to connect with people, share stories, and create memories. Our team is passionate about coffee and dedicated to perfecting the art of cold brew. We take pride in sourcing the best coffee beans from local and international farmers, ensuring that each cup of cold brew is of the highest quality. Our commitment to excellence is reflected in every aspect of our business, from the selection of beans to the brewing process and customer service. Today, Kedai Coldbrew XYZ is recognized as a leader in the cold brew coffee industry. Our commitment to quality, innovation, and customer satisfaction has earned us numerous accolades and a reputation for excellence. We are proud to be a part of the vibrant coffee community in Indonesia and look forward to sharing our passion for cold brew with coffee lovers around the world.
